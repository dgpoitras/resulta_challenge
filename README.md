# resulta_challenge
coding challenge for resulta application

I am using Pipenv to create the python environment

Wrote it using Python 3.10

basic steps for writing was.

1. look at data from urls
2. setup script to get data.
3. setup script to store data.
4. setup script to allow for optional data through arguments (date, league)
5. setup processing
	a. Team rankings I created as a named tuple as in a more intensive application it could be processed less often than the scoreboard. Also it could just have changes to fields that are different.. treating it a bit more like a database record.
	b. Scorboard data can be place directly into output.
6. Debugging
7. Documentation in code.
8. Final test.
